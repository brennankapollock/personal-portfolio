itâ€™s a comical consequence of the age
that through the looking glass
i see friends in a shrouded mist
around them buzz: bees, flames, birds
all appear and annoy and confuse
truly unwanted and undesired for
before my resurrection i rarely knew
such digital creatures and ever since
only one graceful deer frolics in sun
through my leaves: in ink, dream, prayer
through song and scripture she frolics

i am a deer also though not as tan
a strong yet soft creature of the leaves
a slight silver limp from years past
that is all i carry in my slender legs
and as i rest laying down today
in the good hours of the day i exclaim
to old friends and birds and bees
my star-crossed and sun-drenched state of being
of being a man weaved into fabric
of being a deer on cobblestone
wanting nothing but her as a whole
as a woman draped in integrity and exuberant joy 
as a deer in the expansive meadow

i am startled and shook by the rustling
a rustling as to whether to stand or sit
to play it cool like the lonely masses on concrete
or to listen to that volcanic thing that is my soul
these leaves and the breath of god parading 
they shall tell me to be remain true to truth
through these ascending days of spring

i, a little deer possessing these:
a wore out pen, a heart, two hands, one body
holding nothing but to hope, faith, and love
of a promise and reassurance 
if you will so softly assist me in the sea
accepting the holy chime of the old ones
the sea of spring, life, vitality, and dance

so, the sound calls, i look upwards now
i walk strong and secure into her meadow daily
i, unafraid to give my all, the tender flame warm
walking closer every second of every second
i go doing fred astair's two step
sealed as a sacrament with her
as a deer in the meadow of forgotten realms
